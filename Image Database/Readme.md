The dataset contains 6400 MRI images of Brain that indicated Alzheimer's disease or not.
In the dataset, there are two main folders which are
          -Train folder
          -Test folder

Training data set contain 5121 images.
Testing data contain 1279 data images that spread across four subfolders

The Data set is taken from the Kaggle dataset which contains three types of diseases.
They are:
1)Mild Demented
2)Moderate Demented
3)Very Mild Demented
4)Non Demented(HEALTHY)
This folder contains the code to train the machine learning model.

The following are the files used to train the model with MRI images.
data_train_Alzheimer_MildDemented
data_train_Alzheimer_MildDemented
data_train_Alzheimer_VeryMildDemented
data_train_Alzheimer_NonDemented

The followingf are the .mat files generated after training of model with MRI images
Alzheimer_MildDemented
Alzheimer_ModerateDemented
Alzheimer_VeryMildDemented
Alzheimer_NonDemented

EvaluateFeatures_Grayscale-is the file which contains 13 features which are evaluated.
Train_final_save_Alzheimer-is the file used to merge the all generated .mat files into single file.
